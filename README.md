# `size-limit-tiny-time`

Because @size-limit/time pulls in wayyyyy too many dependencies. Pretty ironic for a size limiting tool to be so heavy, right?

## Usage

Just add to your package.json. It should be automatically detected.

Make sure to remove `@size-limit/time` first.

## License

Same as the original - MIT.
